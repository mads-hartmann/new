# `new`

This is my starting point for *new* things. 

The basic setup ...

- [nix](https://nix.dev) is used to manage dependencies configure the shell
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) is used to have folder-specific shell configurations. Right now it's mostly useful to have `Ã¹se nix` which means nix controls my shell through [nix-shell](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/nix-shell.html).
